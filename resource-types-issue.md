Hey Everyone, 

As we move into the resource marketplace for Concourse [AKA project dutyfree], we are requesting the resource type contributors to add their resources here as explained in the [readme](https://github.com/concourse/resource-types/blob/master/README.md).

I am tagging all the contributors that were listed under the original [Concourse wiki](uhttps://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Resource-Types) and awaiting your kind feedback.
