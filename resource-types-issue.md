Hey Folks, 

As we move into the resource marketplace for Concourse (AKA project [dutyfree](https://github.com/concourse/dutyfree/)), we are requesting the resource type contributors to add their resources here.

I am tagging all the contributors that were listed under the original [Concourse wiki](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/wiki/Resource-Types) and awaiting your kind feedback.

The whole contrinution process is explained in this repo's [readme](https://github.com/concourse/resource-types/blob/master/README.md). We will value any feedback around the process and/or the documentation as well.
